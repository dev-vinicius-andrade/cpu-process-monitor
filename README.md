# Project
This project is a very simple win forms app that the main goal is to monitor a process CPU usage and kill it if it reaches a especific value.

It's a proof of concept because I was playing a game that was freezing my computer and I wanted to avoid needing to hard reboot it everytime.
It's not beautiful, it's not optimized, but for me it's working so far.
Maybe in the future I will improve it, but for now it's enough.

## How to use
1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/dev-vinicius-andrade/cpu-process-monitor/releases)
2. Unzip it to a desired location
3. Open your desidered process as usal
4. Open the app **"Cpu.Monitor.App.exe"**
5. Select the process you want to monitor
	6.1. If your process is not listed, you can refresh the list by clicking the "Refresh" button
7. Set the CPU usage limit
8. Set the interval time to check the CPU usage
9. Click in "Monitor" button

That's it.
